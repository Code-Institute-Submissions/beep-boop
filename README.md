## UX
### User Profiles
As a user of this website, I am someone looking for a quick and fun memory game to play. I could be of any age over the age of around 6 years old, with at least a basic understanding of English.

### User Stories
As a user of the website, I want:
* To play a memory game
* To easily understand how to navigate the website
* To interact with the website and gain immediate feedback from my interaction
* The game to be simple to understand and play
* To be able to read the game instructions should I need them
* To be able to change the difficulty of the game to be easier or harder
* To be able to play the game with or without sounds
* To be able to play the game on any device

<a name="design"></a>
## Design
The overall design concept of the website was to make a memory game with the aesthetic of a physical toy that may have been manufactured in the 1980's. The general idea of the game is based heavily on the game 'Simon' which was first manufactured in 1978.
The game and all navigational features fit within a container which stays the same size as the user navigates through the website. This gives the impression of there being a solid and material object on the page. The game container features a subtle inset box shadow, used to add to the illusion of the game being a 3D object. As well as this, all buttons feature an offset box shadow which gives the impression they are elevated from the background. This box shadow effect is removed when the buttons are clicked to seem as though the button has physically moved. When the buttons found on the main game page light up, a radial gradient effect is used to make the centre of the button the brightest, with the brightness slowly fading outwards. This is to suggest that there is a light bulb in the centre of the button. As well as this, a box shadow effect is used to suggest that the immediate area surrounding the button is being illuminated by the button (see image below).

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme for the website began with the concept of using yellow for the body of the game and purple for the background. These colours were chosen because of their stark contrast from each other due to being opposites on the colour spectrum. The bright yellow of the game naturally draws the user's eye to it when set against the purple background. The background itself was then made to look more fun and exciting with the addition of colourful geometric shapes which also adds to the 80's aesthetic of the page.
The colour palette for the buttons found within the game (excluding the purple **'START'** button and light yellow **'MAIN MENU'**) were derived from a palette generated by the website https://www.coolors.co/. The picture below displays the colour chart provided by the website.

![Colour palette from https://www.coolors.co](assets/images/readme-images/palette.png "Colour palette from https://www.coolors.co")

This palette was chosen as it contains 4 distinct colours that could be used for the four 'light-up' buttons found in the game. The colours **'Kelly Green' #29BF12**, **'Maximum Blue Green' #08BDBD**, **'Red Munsell' F21B3F** and **'Yellow Orange Color Wheel' #FF9914** were used as a basis, before being darkened slightly in order to accentuate the difference when the buttons are 'lit-up'.

### Fonts
The font used for the 'BEEP - BOOP' logo is **'Faster One'** from Google Fonts. This was used as it is a striking font, with the trailing lines alluding to speed and movement. [Click here to view logo.](assets/images/readme-images/logo.jpg)

Most of the text on the website is **'Bungee'** from Google Fonts. This font was chosen as it is bold and clearly legible, as well as being somewhat reminiscent of the font used for the Pacman computer games, which suits the 80's theme of the website. The font used for the tagline **'An audio / visual memory game'** is **'Bungee Shade'**, also from Google Fonts. [Click here to view Bungee font in use.](assets/images/readme-images/bungee-font.jpg)

For more verbose sections of the website, the font **'DM Mono'** from Google Fonts was used as it has a vaguely digital feel to it which suits the computer game aesthetic, whilst remaining clearly legible. This font can be found in the **'How to play'** modal, as well as in the descriptions of the difficulty options. [Click here to view DM mono font in use.](assets/images/readme-images/dm-mono-font.jpg)

The font **'Digital-7'** was used in the level display to give the effect of it being an old LCD display, similar to that found on calculators. This helped add to the illusion of the website being a physical toy. [Click here to view the level display.](assets/images/readme-images/level-display.jpg)

## Features
### Implemented Features
The website features 3 separate pages (**index.html**, **difficulty.html** and **game.html**). Each of these pages contains a single container that holds all the necessary elements required to navigate around the website and interact with the game. This container and its contents are responsive to the user's device viewport, and the container is always the same dimensions across the 3 pages. All navigational elements have mouse hover effects to reassure the user that they are indeed clickable links.

#### Index.html
This is the landing page for the website. The user is immediately presented with the game logo, followed by the tagline 'An audio / visual memory game' thus establishing the purpose of the website very quickly. Below this are 3 clearly labelled buttons:

**PLAY WITH AUDIO** (Highly recommended) - By clicking on this button, the user moves through to the next page of the website (**difficulty.html**). The button also sets the key/value pair of **"audio: 'true'"** to the user's browsers session storage. This item is then evaluated in the JavaScript code, to determine whether audio is triggered when playing the game. 

**PLAY ON MUTE** - This functions the same way as the **'PLAY WITH AUDIO'**  button, however the key/value pair are set to **"audio: 'false'"**.

**HOW TO PLAY** - This button triggers a modal, which contains a short set of instructions on how to play the game. The modal can be closed either by clicking on the **'CLOSE'** button, or by clicking anywhere outside of the modal body.

If the session storage item is not set (i.e. the user goes straight to **game.html**), the game defaults to audio being enabled as this is the recommended way to play the game.

#### difficulty.html
Once through to this page, the user is asked to **'SELECT DIFFICULTY'** and presented with a further 3 buttons titles **'EASY'**, **'NORMAL'** and **'HARD'**. Each button is accompanied by a short description of what each difficulty option entails. Again, by clicking on one of these buttons, a session storage item is set which is later evaluated in the JavaScript code and used to determine certain factors of the user's game experience.

Below these three buttons, a more subtle button is offered to return the user to the **'MAIN MENU'** which links back to **index.html**. This ensures good UX as the user cannot get 'trapped' on this page and can return to the main menu to check how to play the game or select a different audio setting.

#### game.html
The **game.html** page contains the actual game aspect of the website. Below the BEEP - BOOP logo, the user finds 4 large buttons of varying colours. These are the buttons with which the user plays game. Beneath this, is another button which links the user back to the main menu. This button is styled in the same manner as the main menu link found on **difficulty.html** to ensure consistency throughout the website. Next to the main menu link is a level display which initially prompts the user to **'PRESS START'**, and then once the game has begun displays the current level of the game. Next to this is the **'START'** button which triggers the start of the game.

Should the user be successful in completing the game, a 'success jingle' is triggered, the game buttons flash 2 times and the level display text changes to "YOU WON!". Following this, a modal pops up to congratulate the user and if the game was played on easy or normal difficuly, suggests playing again on a higher difficulty with a link to difficulty.html. Should the user lose the game, a 'fail jingle' and all the game buttons flash 2 times and the level display text changes to "GAME OVER!". Following this, a modal pops up to say the game is over, inform the user of which level they reached, and if played on easy or normal difficulty, suggests playing the game on an easier difficulty with a link to difficulty.html.

#### 404.html
The **404.html** page is a custom 404 error response page should the user mis-type the URL. The page informs the user "There is no BEEP - BOOP here!" and provides a link to the main menu (index.html).

#### Potential Future Features
I think that the game and its features are best kept simple, however in the future I may look at adding 'lives' to the game that allow the user to replay a level without starting from level 1 should they make a mistake. The number of lives allowed could change depending on the difficulty level chosen by the user.

Another idea would be to allow the user to set their own difficulty level by setting the length of the interval in between beeps, and by choosing how many beeps are required to complete the game.

## Testing
### Testing against user requirements (as listed in UX section)
* To play a memory game
  * This requirement is met by the website by providing a memory game!
  
* To interact with the website and gain immediate feedback from my interaction
  * The game responds to user clicks with immediate audio and visual feedback. If the user successfully completes the game, the level display shows **"YOU WIN!"** and a triumphant 8-bit jingle is sounded. If the user makes a mistake, the level display shows **"GAME OVER!"** and a game-over jingle sounds. The game-over jingle is reminiscent  of classic old-school arcade game game-over sounds. Outside of the game itself, all clickable links have hover effects to reassure the user that they are indeed clickable links hen the mouse is moved over them.
  
* The game to be simple to understand and play
  * The game is a very simple concept taken from the game 'Simon'. Whilst anyone familiar  with the game 'Simon' would immediately understand how to play, even without prior knowledge the user can quickly come to understand the rules of the game due to its simple nature and audio/visual feedback.
  
* To be able to read the game instructions should I need them
  * Should the user not understand the game, there is a clear **"HOW TO PLAY"** button presented on the landing page for the website. This page is easily accessible from anywhere on the website.

* To be able to play the game with or without sounds
  * This option is presented to the user immediately upon loading the website. On **index.html** 2 buttons clearly state **"PLAY WITH AUDIO"** or **"PLAY ON MUTE"**. This page (signposted as **"MAIN MENU"**) is clearly accessible from anywhere within the website.
  
* To be able to change the difficulty of the game to be easier or harder
  * Having selected the audio setting, the users are presented with **difficulty.html**. On this page there are 3 buttons labelled **"EASY"**, **"NORMAL"** and **"HARD"**. Beneath the buttons is a short description of what each difficulty setting means.
  
* To be able to play the game on any device
  * The website has been designed and tested with the aim of enabling the game to be played on as many devices as possible. With this in mind, the CSS code has been made as cross browser compatible as possible with the help of [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/). All code has been validated through [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) for JavaScript, [W3C's](https://www.w3.org/) CSS and HTML validators. As well as this, the pages are all highly responsive with the design being suitable for devices of around a 270px square upwards.

### Validation
The HTML code has been checked against the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), the CSS against the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the JavaScript against the [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) code analysis tool, with any issues highlighted by the validators fixed. The code contains no validity issues.

### Responsive testing
The website has been developed and tested to ensure a high level of responsiveness. This has been achieved using Google Chrome Dev Tools, testing on different physical devices and by viewing the site on [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).

### Manual testing of all elements throughout the website

##### Testing JavaScript functions and logic
1. Testing session storage data and outcomes
    * Navigate from **index.html** to **difficulty.html** using the **"PLAY WITH AUDIO"** button. On **difficulty.html**, navigate to **game.html** using **"EASY"** button.
    * Within the console in **game.html**, check session storage for **"audio: 'true'**, **difficulty: 'easy'**.
    * Using the **"START"** button, begin the game and check that the interval between beeps is as expected.
    * Ensure that the audio is playing.
    * Complete 3 successful repetitions and ensure the **winGame()** function is called.
    
Repeat these tests for all difficulty settings ensuring that the session storage data is correct for each instance. Ensure that the number of repetitions to win the game and the interval between beeps is as expected. Repeat for all difficulty settings again having selected **"PLAY ON MUTE"** from **index.html**, also ensuring that no audio is triggered.

2. Testing game functions (after pressing **"START"** button)
    * Ensure game begins.
    * Successfully repeat computer sequence - ensure a new round is started and that it is one beep longer than the previous round.
    * Enter incorrect sequence - ensure that the game ends and **gameOver()** is called and functions correctly.
    * Complete the game - ensure the **gameWin()** is called and functions correctly.
    * Press **'START'** button before game ends and during computers turn - ensure a new game is not started and the level display states "PLEASE WAIT".
    * Press **'START'** button before game ends and during users turn - ensure a new game is started.
    * Press **'START'** button during **winGame()** and **loseGame()** - ensure a new game is not started and the level display states "PLEASE WAIT".

### Additional Testing
* Friends and family asked to visit the website and report on any bugs or UX issues - no undocumented issues have been found.
* Website posted to 'Peer Code Review' on the Code Institute Slack channel.

### Found Bugs
During testing, a bug was found where if the user clicks on the **'START'** button whilst the **compPlay()** function is still being called by **setInterval()**. The **setInterval()** methods fails to be cleared by the **interval ID** and therefore **compPlay()** gets stuck in a loop. To fix this issue, the **START** button only triggers a new game once the **setInterval()** method has been cleared. This means that a new game cannot be started whilst the **compPlay()** function is running. Instead, the level display tells the user to 'PLEASE WAIT' until the **START** button becomes functional again once the compPlay() function has stopped.
